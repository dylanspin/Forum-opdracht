      <div class="text"><br>Java is a programming language that produces software for multiple platforms.
         When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems (OS),<br>
          including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Java derives much of its syntax from the C and C++ programming languages.<br>
          Java was developed in the mid-1990s by James A. Gosling, a former computer scientist with Sun Microsystems.
          Java produces applets (browser-run programs), which facilitate graphical user interface (GUI)<br>
          and object interaction by Internet users. Prior to Java applets, Web pages were typically static and non-interactive.
          Java applets have diminished in popularity with the release of competing products,<br> such as Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight.
          Java applets run in a Web browser with Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which translates Java bytecode into native processor instructions <br>
      </div><br><br>
      <div class="text"><br>  and  allows indirect OS or platform program execution.
        JVM provides the majority of components needed to run bytecode, which is usually smaller than executable programs
        written through other programming languages.<br>
        Bytecode cannot run if a system lacks required JVM.Java program development requires a Java software development kit (SDK)
          that typically includes a compiler, interpreter, documentation generator and other tools used<br> to produce a complete application.
